    <p>Hello</p>
    <p>Just your average software dev that hopes to use this site to have a creative outlet while
    improving some aspects of my dev skills.
    </p>
    <p>
    This site is under some construction. My future plans are to:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Add new the new pages you see in the nav bar.</li>
        <li>Add content.</li>
        <li>Oranize the content.</li>
        <li>Figure out what I want the landing page to be.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    I can't wait for this to look as good as my middle school myspace page.
    </p>
