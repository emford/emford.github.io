    <p>About</p>
    <p>I am Emily Ford. I am a developer, artist, and reader.</p>
    <p>My work in software has been focused on backend development for the past six years. My main language is Python.</p>
    <p>In art, I primarily work with graphite and colored pencil illustrations. I am looking forward to progressing my skills in charcoal and watercolor.</p>
    <p>As a reader, I enjoy ALL the genres. I am currently focusing my efforts on rereading and exploring classical literature.</p>
